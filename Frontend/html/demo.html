<p>The cinnamon quail-thrush (Cinclosoma cinnamomeum) is a species of bird in the family Cinclosomatidae. Endemic to Australia, it is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions of the central part of the continent, spanning southwest Queensland, northwest New South Wales, northeastern South Australia, and the southeast of the Northern Territory. It is most commonly found among dry stony areas, especially around dry creek lines, although it is also sometimes encountered in grass and shrublands. The cinnamon quail-thrush has a body length of 20 centimetres (7.9 in) and a mass of up to 50 grams (1.8 oz) when fully grown. Male birds are characterised by a white eyebrow, black face and a broad white streak down the sides of a black throat. The upperparts of their body are plain cinnamon-rufous with buff-white patches on the upper breast and a broad black band below. The outer tail feathers are black with white tips. The female has similar features but duller with a buff-white throat and eyebrow. This cinnamon quail-thrush was photographed by the Stuart Highway near Hugh, Northern Territory, about 88 kilometres (55 mi) southwest of Alice Springs.</p>
